# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## Overview
This project provides an opportunity to demonstrate the skill to collect, work with and clean data sets for  analysis.

This repository hosts the R code,  documentation and tidy data  files for the course "Getting and Cleaning data", offered by John Hopkins thru coursera.

The dataset used downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Files

The code  expects input data to be present in the two sub-directories named test and train under 'UCI HAR Dataset' as un-compressed text files.

Please find the description of the variables and the data in CodeBook.md.run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the five steps described in the course porject. It can be sourced in RStudio after importing the file.

The final clean data which can be directly used for analysis  is named as tidy_data.txt.
